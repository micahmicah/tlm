  poem: "<p>The Vessel Song<br>
  Chant “Old beyond old time”<br>
  Slow even breaths now<br>
  Don’t fight it: sleep.</p>
  
  <p>The recurring dream returns,<br>
  Again the Augean dreamdig</p>
  
  <p>Inside<br>
  Layers of turf, soil and stone,<br>
  Paper, plastic, and rustnails lie<br> 
  where all things tremble and hide.</p>
  
  <p>Fight in the dank dark deep<br>
  Pull it scratch it yank it<br>  
  Soilstonetrash, deeproots and moist moss<br> 
  centipedes white flies worms spiders<br>
  Wrestle with you but you</p>  
  
  <p>Morewrestle</p> 
  
  <p>From its refuge the amphora older than old.</p>
  
  <p>Burnish your bright night vessel with moist moss<br>
  as centipedes white flies worms and spiders<br> 
  inscribe your vessel with swirling figures.</p>  
  
  <p>Thus your prized vase, so perfect;<br>
  Sob and fill it with salty tears</p>
  
  <p>As it chants back to you “old beyond” every night,<br>
  Your tears and vessel crumble into pigment and you begin to<br>
  Paint.</p>"

- title: "Sarcophagus"
  date: "2021"
  poem: "<p>It is said that M<br>
of the squashed nose<br>
large arms and larger reputation <br>
Went to sea with his only child, his daughter, <br>
Dead of a broken neck, little cross-eyed thing. <br>
He laid her arms left above right, <br>
Her legs straight with toes pointed upward. <br>
 In a vessel of floating wood <br>
M drifted into the sea from the mouth of Ostia, <br>
And asked the salt water to take them to Paros.</p>

<p>Past Naples, past Brindisi, <br>
Taken by the current into the Aegean, <br>
Trusting in the pull of Paros.</p>

<p>Parched and exhausted even of dreams<br> 
Dragged ashore in Paros by startled fishermen M awoke to<br> 
thwack thwack <br>
The fishermen pounding live octopi.</p>

<p>This island is all about pounding, <br>
From mollusks to hammers and chisels. <br>
 M came through the treacherous Cycladic sea to Paros <br>
To bury his daughter with her exact likeness in stone: <br>
A Parian doll with painted crossed eyes <br>
Crossed arms, arched back with toes pointed <br>
upward with a <br>
broken neck </p>

<p> <em>This tale is true <br>
for I saw with my own eyes <br>
The tell-tale signature of M <br>
carved inside the marble quarry of Paros. </em></p>

<p> After her entombment, <br>
After his bereavement, <br>
M remained in the quarry living on sea creatures and wine. <br>
He chiseled day in day out into his final years, <br>
Making not the figures for which he was famous <br>
But four spheres <br>
in homage to Giotto.</p>

<p>For the tale goes thus: <br>
Giotto drew a perfect circle for the Pope as proof of his abilities.<br> 
So likewise, <br> 
M carved four planets of marble <br>
After which he died content <br>
on the island of Paros.</p>

<p>The fishermen laid him beside his daughter and doll <br>
Both real <br>
Both necks broken <br>  
With his four spheres <br>
Into his wooden boat <br>
Into the quarry</p>

<p>Their sarcophagus.</p>

  with iceeyes <br>
  Sets out.</p>
  
  <p>But furyrowing <br>
  takes him nowhere.</p>
  
  <p>Yet <br>
  after years or an instant <br>
  his stoneboat arrives in <br>
  memorious olive trees, <br>
  desquamated birches with moss coats, <br> 
  fluorescent amsonia, <br>
  erethizontidae fur, quills, paw prints, <br>
  abandoned detritus.</p>
  
  <p>There everywhere <br>
  A library of 1,299,827 souls (F counted).</p>
  
  <p>He unloads his iceeyes <br>
  in years or an instant <br>
  eyes to each soul’s sockets.</p>
  
  <p>The last pair, his grandmother’s eyes.</p> 
  
  <p>Her death date, his birth date <br>
  Her iceeyes</p>
  
  <p>Now his eyes.</p>"

  <p>&ldquo;It’s in his skin – <br>
  &emsp; his skin scales of soiled green shoots<br> 
  and flies<br>
  where the signs arise.&rdquo;</p>
  
  <p>Within his skin<br>
  I hear the ticking Ghost, &ldquo; Spring damp dew,<br>
  &emsp; watch the flies come to you.&rdquo;<br>
  &emsp;So I do.</p>
     
  <p>And when they arrive, flies find a sweet perfume.</p>
  
  <p>Here lies Webern gone away<br>
  Shot in the chest<br>
  &emsp; is all they say.</p>"

    Night rain.<br>
    Drink my tears, she says. <br> 
    Drench the soil.<br>
    Seep into tunnels<br>
    Where roots hang<br>
    Like chiroptera.<br> 
    Fill your veins to overflowing, she says,<br> 
    Until my nectar drips – <br> 
    My nectar that blinks bright<br>
    Like night’s fireflies, <br>
    Calling the sleeping hordes to rise,<br>
    Wave after wave,<br> 
    And break the silence with marching feet.</p>"

  poem: "<p>She says, drink where I drink, where<br>
The ghosts of deer go.</p>

 <p>Drink their shy silhouettes in watery vertigo and<br>
Ride their wet fur and<br>
Kiss their salty eyes Under the nefarious light.</p>

 <p>A firefly steals the one spider web<br>
Whose elastic orb re-threads Linnaeus’s quilt and<br>
Whose piano strings bind wing to wing.</p>

 <p>This is your map, she says, my maze,<br>
That takes us back to our nest of sleep,<br>
To the dizzy embers of fire and fireflies And shaded silhouettes.</p>

<p>Take this spider map, this sinuous map.<br>
Take this so you can find me,<br>
Find me always<br>
Where the ghosts of deer go.

  poem: "<p>Or<br> 
  Maybe it is bleached white from the desert:<br>
  A discarded hurdy-gurdy<br>
  Turned to stone in the Kapadokian sun.<br> 
  Or <br>
  Maybe it is Parian marble chiseled by Myron.<br>
  Translucent like skin<br>
  White as flake salt<br>
  Fused ice. <br>
  Or <br>
  Maybe it is my first piano, my toy piano.<br>
  Prized above all my pianos<br>
  Where once I banged away  <br>
  Like Nancarrow.<br>
  For this was the beginning of it all, the It.<br>
  Now in my late years I paint my toy white; <br>
  But it is not a toy but the yearly ritual <br>
  Of my decay.</p>"

  poem: "<p>His point of view:</p>

  <p>His lineage is Quixada or Quesada,<br> 
  His plumage blue grey.<br>
  With armored beak thus the great heron<br>
  The grand fisherman<br>
  The hunter.<br>
  In the tall reeds where bass feel safe<br>
  The heron stalks.</p>

  <p>My point of view:</p>
  
  <p>This comedic error on stilts of sticks and string,<br>
  Lug nuts, recycled bags, rotting newspapers:<br> 
  Spare parts.<br>
  
  <p>Their point of view:</p> 
  
  <p>Oblivious to danger they glide<br> 
  Among the reeds<br>
  To nibble insects and make bubbles</p>
  
  <p>While above, the creature stops.<br>
  Poises.<br>
  His neck arches, arches back, his arrow beak points.<br>
  Wait, wait, tense, wait. Pupils dilate.<br>
  Snap.</p>

  <p>The hunter, now perfect, now Mithras, <br>
  Shudders and chokes it down.<br>
  With gills gasping for water, its eyes shocked<br>
  That its purpose is not to swim forever<br>
  But to be sucked into this horrific cave of muscle. </p>
  
  God’s point of view: </p>
  
  This heron is my prime number, my Quexana.</p>"
