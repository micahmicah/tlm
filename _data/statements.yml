  statement: "<p>In her novel The Abyss, Marguerite Yourcenar 
  quotes an alchemical saying: <em>obscurum per obscurius; ignotum 
    per ignotius,</em> which roughly translates, <em>proceed toward the obscure 
      and unknown through the still more obscure and unknown.</em></p>
  
  <p>All my work begins with my dreams, recorded in sketchbooks with 
  narratives and drawings. These dreams are often prophetic, telling 
  me where I need to travel to work — to make one world, one cosmology, 
  where the seen and the unseen co-exist.</p> 
  
  <p>Once my dreams have led me to a site, I develop my pieces slowly, 
  carrying them back and forth between sites, cross-pollinating ideas, 
  locations, and subject matter — all united in the studio. Time is no 
  longer linear, but elastic, continuous, and circular.</p>
  
  <p>In Italy I have worked in many closed mithraeums (the man-made caves 
  of the astrological cult of Mithras), the Roman Colosseum’s hypogeum, 
  Etruscan ruins, the temple at Gabii, in churches and archeological sites 
  throughout southern Italy and Sicily (especially in Matera, Alberobello, 
  and Otranto), and in numerous catacombs — all closed to the public. 
  Outside of Italy, my dreams have led me to Mayan sites and abandoned 
  silver mines in Mexico, to the top of the Parthenon in Greece, down into 
  the ancient, abandoned quarry on the island of Paros (famous for its 
  translucent marble), and in Central Turkey, to the cryptic frescoes 
  within monasteries and underground cities in Kapadokya.</p>
  
  <p>The catacombs — my primary focus — are silent mazes, cold and dank. 
  Skeletons, nearly two thousand years old, embrace one another in their 
  tombs, and, if disturbed, would turn to dust. Paintings and carvings 
  form mysterious, iconographic hybrids of an emerging spiritual language. 
  Worms with millipede-like legs coexist with 10-inch long phosphorescent 
  mantises that give off an eerie green light. Blind translucent spiders 
  the size of my hand make clicking sounds on the tunnel walls while 
  aphids skitter by the thousands up stalactites. </p>
  
  <p>In addition to my “dream-books” and paintings, I have built a 
  library of sketchbooks that form an archive of images from museums, 
  archeological sites, and landscapes. Using these combined tools I want 
  my search to be a gift that visualizes the most arcane cosmology, where 
  intimate secrets lead to endless questions and possibilities.</p>"

  statement: "<p>My studio is on fire, so what do I grab? 
  No pets here; it's my sketchbooks. Carefully annotated and 
  lined up on shelves, I would need a chute to send these stacks 
  and stacks out the window, but they must be saved for they are my 
  encyclopedia, my secrets.</p>

  <p>Ever since I can remember I have kept three kinds of sketchbooks, 
  all carefully annotated and cross-referenced.</p>

  <p>First, in hand-made hardbound books, I draw, paint and collage everywhere: 
  from subway tunnels to museums; beside hospital patients 
  and at chamber concerts. Second, because I am a compulsive drawer, I keep 
  &ldquo;sketch boxes&rdquo; wherein I put myriad drawings made on meeting 
  agendas, waiting-room magazines and assorted scraps.</p>

  <p>The third kind of sketchbooks I keep are my bound, hardcover 
  &ldquo;dream books&rdquo;, one of which is always by my bedside, 
  accompanied by writing and drawing implements. I know through experience 
  that without my book and materials at hand that the recurring dreams 
  and prophetic dreams on which my work relies would dissolve into the 
  early morning ether. My ritual is this: early each morning I write down 
  my dreams, often adding drawings and &ldquo;maps&rdquo; because, for as long as I 
  can remember, places, animals, departed loved ones, disturbing events 
  and the elastic conundrum of time form a seemingly endless inner world 
  that occurs, for the most part, underground. It is this underground dream 
  world, more real than what I see as I write this, that has vividly &ldquo;told 
  me&rdquo; 
  what to explore and where to work on-site.</p>

  <p>These &ldquo;real&rdquo; spaces feed my dream life, alter time, and 
  coalesce into one, unbroken cycle of waking and sleep.</p>"

- title: "Teaching"
  image: assets/img/statements/tom-students-02.jpg
  statement: "<p>In his commentary on Fernando Pessoa’s <em>The Book of Disquiet,</em> John Lanchester 
  says this book “does for [modern] man what Montaigne did in the 16th Century… In a time 
  which celebrates fame, success, stupidity, convenience and noise, here is the perfect 
  antidote, a hymn of praise to obscurity, failure, intelligence, difficulty, and silence.”</p>
  
  <p>For what is the purpose of creativity but to actively seek the deepest insights into 
  humanity through the crucible of making, and more importantly, un-making?</p>
  
  <p>Despite increasingly precise measurements, contemporary maps of the cosmos or the 
  minutiae of the sub-atomic world will likely be no more accurate in the future than 
  ancient seafaring maps that included half-remembered landscapes and sea monsters. </p>
  
  <p>Like mapmakers, we draw and paint what we observe, but find our drawings inevitably 
  cross over into the unknown, for, like maps, they are never truly, wholly accurate, never 
  allowing for shifting points of view or even the necessity of dreams.</p>
  
  <p>This then is our region – where the visible and invisible meet, where the observed and 
  the intuitive lie side by side, and where the seen pays a constant debt to the unseen.</p>
  
  <p>Everything changes when we draw: channels open up between our eyes and our breathing, 
  heart rate, and neurological paths.  Borders dissolve between touch, smell, and sound. 
  The ideas absorbed when we draw are infinitely better than when we don’t draw.  And, 
  like making maps, what we draw we remember; what we don’t draw, we forget.</p>
  
  <p>But like maps, drawing is about the specific, not the general: about revealing ideas 
  with precision and authority.  Ironically, it is the discrepancy between one’s unfocussed 
  marks – one’s lack of precision compared with the purity of the subject, full of 
  complexity and unseen forces at work – that leads to the prolonged search.</p>
  
  <p>The initial marks we make are only the beginning: it is when we begin to unmake these 
  marks through sanding and erasing, that drawing becomes thinking.  By deliberate and 
  often painstaking removal, by <em>excavating</em>, the drawing starts to reveal its true self.  
  Clouds of erased marks ensue, and the search is fully underway.</p>"


- title: "Acknowledgements"

  statement: "<p>Were it not for the things we make and for those we 
  love as evidence of a life lived, what we call Time might leave 
  life hopelessly incomprehensible. After over thirty years of living 
  on and off in Rome, Time, on the one hand, laughs at how little I 
  have seen. On the other hand, the friendships I have made are resilient 
  to the whims of the calendar. Thirty years in Rome is nothing, but 
  thirty years of friendship is more than many less fortunate will ever 
  experience.</p> 
  <p>To Ezio Genovesi, Director of the Rhode Island School of Design’s 
  European Honors Program, my first friend in Rome: I cannot imagine 
  doing what I have done without his wisdom, generosity, and the 
  closeness I feel for him, his talented wife Laura Graham, and their 
  children. To Peter Gardner and Barbara Foley, Luisa Guarneri and 
  Jonathan Hynd, Cinzia Abbate and Maryann Fennimore Kranis and family: 
  they are all visionary and humane thinkers who like strong gravitational 
  planets keep me centered.</p> 
  <p>My work in the catacombs would not be possible without the vivacious 
  support of Valentina Luciani, and the mystical presence of Padre 
  Alessandro Venturin, who seems to accompany me even when he is not 
  there. I am further indebted to the support, inspiration, and kindness 
  of Don Edoardo Parisoto and Don Franco (Francesco) Gualtieri, as well 
  as to Silvia Orlandi, whose scholarship in the study of ancient texts 
  is invaluable, and to Dante Braido, whose gardens are a place of 
  tranquility and great beauty.</p> 
  <p>Over the years I have been embraced by the individuals who watch 
  over and protect the Colosseum: together we relax after closing and 
  celebrate holidays as a family.  To Filippo Favale, Paolo and Cinzia 
  Pescosolido, and Stefania Pagliaricci, who together know no limits to 
  the word “generosity”. The feast that Filippo, Paolo, Cinzia, and 
  Stefania arranged with Massimo and Cinzia Vennetilli at the mysterious 
  site of Gabii may be the happiest day of my life.</p>  
  <p>I wish to thank Frank Maresca, who is perpetually incisive, 
  brilliant and full of a vivacious spirit to which we all can aspire.</p>  
  <p>Above all, this site is dedicated to the love of my life, Susan 
  Werner.</p> "

- title: "Ringraziamenti"

  statement: "<p>Se non fosse per le cose che facciamo e per coloro 
  che amiamo a testimonianza di una vita vissuta, quello che chiamiamo 
  Tempo, con la sua natura elastica, lascerebbe le nostre vite 
  irrimediabilmente incomprensibili e senza senso.  Dopo oltre trenta 
  anni in cui ho vissuto più o meno frequentemente a Roma, il Tempo 
  sembra irridere rispetto a quanto poco ho visto.  Trenta anni a 
  Roma sono niente, ma Trenta anni di amicizia sono molto di più 
  di quello che persone meno fortunate di me avranno mai la possibilità 
  di vivere.</p>
  
  <p>I miei ringraziamenti vanno dunque a Ezio Genovesi, Direttore 
  della <em>Rhode Island School of Design’s European Honors Program,</em> il 
  mio primo amico a Roma: non riesco a immaginare come avrei fatto 
  senza la sua saggezza, la sua generosità e la vicinanza che sento 
  per lui, per la sua valente moglie Laura Graham e per i loro figli.</p>
  
  <p>A Peter Gardner e Barbara Foley, Luisa Guarneri e Jonathan Hynd, 
  Cinzia Abbate e Maryann Fennimore  Kranis e sua famiglia: pensatori 
  visionari e umani che come forti pianeti gravitazionali mi hanno 
  aiutato a rimanere centrato.</p>
  
  <p>Il mio lavoro nelle catacombe non sarebbe stato possibile senza 
  l’attiva assistenza di Valentina Luciani e la mistica presenza di 
  Padre Alessandro Venturin, che sembra accompagnarmi anche quando 
  non è presente.  Sono inoltre debitore per il loro sostegno e per 
  la loro gentilezza ai seguenti sacerdoti: Don Edoardo Parisoto e 
  Don Franco (Francesco) Gualtieri, e anche Silvia Orlandi, la cui 
  competenza nello studio dei testi antichi è stata insostituibile, 
  e Dante Braido, i cui giardini sono un posto di quiete e di grande 
  bellezza.</p> 
  
  <p>Nel corso degli anni sono sempre stato accolto con simpatia dai 
  sorveglianti e dai curatori del Colosseo: insieme passiamo qualche 
  momento di relax dopo la chiusura e celebriamo le festività come 
  una famiglia.</p>
  
  <p>A Filippo Favale, a Paolo e Cinzia Pescosolido, a Stefania 
  Pagliaricci: nessuno di loro conosce i limiti della parola “generosità”.  
  a festa che Filippo, Paolo, Cinzia, e Stefania hanno organizzato 
  insieme a Massimo e Cinzia Vennetilli nel misterioso sito archeologico 
  di Gabii la ricorderò come uno dei giorni più felici della mia vita.</p> 
  
  <p>Vorrei infine ringraziare Frank Maresca sempre molto acuta, 
  brillante e piena di quello spirito vivace che tutti vorremmo.</p>
  
  <p>Ma soprattutto, questo website è dedicato al grande amore della 
  mia vita, Susan Werner.</p>"
